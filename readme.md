# Telegram Error Report

Is a simple implementation of the Telegram bot to keep developers updated about applicationsÂ´ errors.

This is a code-level tool, which means that is useful mainly for developers.

With this implementation, the developer can receive exceptions, error 500, brute-force attempts, user cheating behavior, login failed attempts, etc. Use your imagination.
